What I learnt in the lesson today is that you can encode words with a simple formula into code words that you don't understand if you are on the google sheet. You can write the alphabet in column 1 and in column 2 you can re-write the alphabet but 'a’ doesn’t have to be in line with ‘a’ it can be in line with ‘w’. But that means ‘z’ would have to be next to ‘d’ in column 2. Like this. Also I learnt that you you always have to start with an equals sign when typing in the box above the sheet. Where it says ‘fx.’ 

Also I learnt that you can use any word to translate into code with the formula and that you can also use numbers instead of the alphabet, numbers 1 to anything and use that instead of matching letters.
