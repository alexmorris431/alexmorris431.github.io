What I learnt?

I learnt in my lesson on my first day of school that you can change codes (i.e letters and numbers) into real words by typing numbers and letters into a box and the computer then translates it from code to English on Google sheets\Excel, that we can understand.                                 

The beginner phrase everyone uses is "Hello World." This can be translated into code and transformed back into hello world as stated above.

Coding is a computer language I will understand soon.
