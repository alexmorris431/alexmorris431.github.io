    <td> I learnt by simply listening to the teacher and inputting the vlookup code when and where I was supposed to I could complete the task. This was a very effective strategy, as the teacher showed us the correct way to create this certain piece of code. I successfully almost finished my coding today as I have been working on it alot. We were told how to do this in the lesson, but I didn't have enough time to fill it into the sheet so I tried it at home and completed it after asking for the teachers help the day before

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning today was the major distractions from other members in the class, however these did not really ruin my learning, it just made me struggle. I need to work on working faster in the time that we are allowed to work on our own sheet and ignore any distractions.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that I will change for next time is that I will work faster in order to complete as much of the work as possible and not get distracted by others in the class. This will improve my learning, as it means I can understand things a lot better.</td>
