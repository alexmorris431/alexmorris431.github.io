    <td> I learnt by simply listening to the teacher and inputting the code when and where I was supposed to. This was a very effective strategy, as the teacher showed us the correct way to create this certain piece of code. I successfully almost finished my Caesar Code today, I have it working and all that, but I just need to get the N/As to disappear when there is no letter. We were told how to do this in the lesson, but I didn't have enough time to fill it into the sheet.

  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning today was the minor distractions from other members in the class, however these did not really interfere with my learning. I need to work on working faster in the time that we are allowed to work on our own sheet.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that I will change for next time is that I will work faster in order to complete as much of the work as possible and not get distracted by others in the class. This will improve my learning, as it means we can move onto other, harder things more quickly and I can handle it better.</td>
