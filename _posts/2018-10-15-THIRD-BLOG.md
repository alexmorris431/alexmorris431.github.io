    <td> I learnt by simply listening to the teacher and typing the length code when and where I was supposed to I could complete the task easily. This was a very effective strategy, as the teacher showed us the correct way to create the code. I successfully finished my coding today as I have been working on it alot. We were told how to do this in the lesson, but I didn't have enough time to fill it into the sheet so I tried it at home and completed it after asking for the teachers help the day before

    <td>The thing that limited my learning today was the major distractions from other members in the class, however these did not really ruin my learning, it just made me struggle. </td>
